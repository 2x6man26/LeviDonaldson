      <h3>About My Fashion</h3>
      <p>
        My fashion is interesting to say the least. Some days I want to be the center of attention and wear boots with 6 inch heels. Other days I'm lazy and throw on a hoodie and sweatpants and call it good enough.
        I'm slightly aternative so I wear a lot of black and darker colors. I also love braclets so I frequently wear multiple on each arm.

          <h4>I got big boots</h4>
          <p>These boots make quite the impression. I only wear them once every couple of months but people seem to think it's much more often then that.
            This picture also not only features my worst haircut ever but also my infamous trench coat that I got at Goodwill for $20. It is the single best purchase I've ever made.

          <h4>Business Look</h4>
          <p>One of my classmates reccomended this fit and they were on point. I've worn it several times since and gotten many compliments, even from compleate strangers driving by.</p>
