            Memories Haunt Me<br>
            When I used to be happy<br>
            When the times were good<br>
            <br>
            I still have the pictures<br>
            The boy in them looks like me<br>
            It used to be me<br>
            <br>
            But not anymore<br>
            I lost the relationship<br>
            I screwed it all up<br>
            <br>
            They don't talk to me<br>
            No longer care about me<br>
            Gone without a trace<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm stuck with them<br>
            All the happy memories<br>
            We made together<br>

            Gone gone gone gone gone<br>
            Everyone that I have loved<br>
            I drive them away<br>
            <br>
            Memories haunt me<br>
            The person that I once was<br>
            And who was with me<br>
            <br>
            I miss them dearly<br>
            But they're never coming back<br>
            I lost them for good<br>

           I know it's over<br>
           I can see that it's all gone<br>
           She took it from me<br>
           <br>
           I saw her again<br>
           She came to me late last night<br>
           Finally I knew<br>
           <br>
           She said why she left<br>
           I rejoced hearing the news<br>
           I could now move forward<br>
           <br>
           But then I woke up<br>
           And I learned it wasn't real<br>
           And my joy was gone<br>
           <br>
           She took all of it<br>
           She took everything from me<br>
           Leaving me behind<br>
