            Memories Haunt Me<br>
            When I used to be happy<br>
            When the times were good<br>
            <br>
            I still have the pictures<br>
            The boy in them looks like me<br>
            It used to be me<br>
            <br>
            But not anymore<br>
            I lost the relationship<br>
            I screwed it all up<br>
            <br>
            They don't talk to me<br>
            No longer care about me<br>
            Gone without a trace<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm stuck with them<br>
            All the happy memories<br>
            We made together<br>

              Where did that girl go<br>
              The one who took everything<br>
              I have nothing now<br>
              <br>
              I barley knew her<br>
              I can scarcely remember her<br>
              She ran far away<br>
              <br>
              Leaving me behind<br>
              The spark in my eyes is gone<br>
              No saturation<br>
              <br>
              Her face is a blur<br>
              Her eyes void and colorless<br>
              Her hands cold and void<br>
              <br>
              They once comforted<br>
              And the lips reassured me<br>
              And the teeth bit me<br>
              <br>
              At least, they did once<br>
              That was a long time ago<br>
              Feelings don't get old<br>
              <br>
              I want to let go<br>
              I want to tell her goodbye<br>

              Innocence is Gone
              I can't say that I don't know<br>
              I know lots of things<br>
              <br>
              But one thing stands out<br>
              What I'm missing out on<br>
              And what he enjoys<br>
              <br>
              He knows what it's like<br>
              She will meet all of his needs<br>
              Everything he wants<br>
              <br>
              Once she cared for me<br>
              It was so immaculate<br>
              All my needs and wants<br>
              <br>
              She has forgotten<br>
              I have not<br>

            Gone gone gone gone gone<br>
            Everyone that I have loved<br>
            I drive them away<br>
            <br>
            Memories haunt me<br>
            The person that I once was<br>
            And who was with me<br>
            <br>
            I miss them dearly<br>
            But they're never coming back<br>
            I lost them for good<br>

           I Know it's Over<br>
           I can see that it's all gone<br>
           She took it from me<br>
           <br>
           I saw her again<br>
           She came to me late last night<br>
           Finally I knew<br>
           <br>
           She said why she left<br>
           I rejoiced hearing the news<br>
           I could now move forward<br>
           <br>
           But then I woke up<br>
           And I learned it wasn't real<br>
           And my joy was gone<br>
           <br>
           She took all of it<br>
           She took everything from me<br>
           Leaving me behind<br>

              Take a chance<br>
              You know you want to<br>

              Driving by her house<br>
              There's the ghost of memories<br>
              Shock of better times<br>
              When we loved<br>
              <br>
              When she loved<br>
              Now I'm on my own<br>
              I'm stranded without my love<br>

              She's flawless<br>
              She's done nothing wrong<br>
              I can't say a single thing<br>
              because I don't know<br>
              because she left<br>
              Memories stay pure<br>
              The faults and cracks forgotten
              What's left is perfect<br>
              She is perfect<br>
